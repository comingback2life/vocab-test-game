# Guess the Word

Test your vocabulary. :sunglasses:

This application written in React makes a FETCH API call to 
https://random-words-api.vercel.app/word
and generates a unique word each time. 

A user is displayed with a definition and is able to guess the word.

Negative marking for wrong answer. 

 :grin: But, it also displays you the right answer :100:
